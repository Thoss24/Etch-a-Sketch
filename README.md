# Etch-a-Sketch
Currently the game is fully functional, with the option to change the color of the squares to grey, black or random, there is also an eraser feature.
The user can also change the number of pixels on the board, between 2 and 100.
There is also a reset board button and a coloring mode tracker above the board so the user knows when they will color the board or not.
